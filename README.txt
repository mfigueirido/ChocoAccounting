ABOUT THE SOURCE CODE

This project was initiated with two goals in mind:

- Provide us with an easy to use application to manage our home budget.
- Develop it as a learning exercise to get practice in Windows
Presentation Foundation and Entity Framework.

Because of our previous inexperience on those technologies and a tight 
schedule, we have done some things that are functional but infringe 
the model-view-viewmodel pattern WPF is based upon. On top of that,
some glaring limitations of the EF made us take a hacky approach to 
some database operations.

Despite this problems we learnt a lot and achieved what we were sent 
out to. If you feel like it, we encourage you to improve the code.
